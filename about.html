<p class="heading">About Me</p>

    <p>


I'm a Lead Engineer at <a href='https://kinandcarta.com/create'>Kin + Carta Create</a>, specialising in iOS development and all things Mobile.
      </p>
      <p>
My goal as a software developer is to constantly make better user experiences for everyone. I share as much as I can, through my blog and speaking at meet-ups and conferences.
      </p>
      <p>
When I'm not tinkering with tech or hanging out with my wife and daughter, I'm running, playing squash, snowboarding and generally keeping my mind and body active. Or I'm playing the guitar. Badly.
      </p>

You can find me on Twitter as <a href='https://www.twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}'>@{{ site.twitter_username }}</a>. Come and say hi! ðŸ‘‹
