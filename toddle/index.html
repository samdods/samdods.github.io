      Click to download Toddle

    <p>Toddle disables the keyboard and mouse so that your little one can join video calls with loved ones without accidentally quitting.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Download and unzip, then move Toddle into your Applications folder. See GIF below.</p>

    <p>The first time you launch Toddle, it will tell you it's from an untrusted developer. This is just because I haven't paid the £99 per year Apple membership fee.<br>
      So to open it (only the first time), you have to go to your Applications folder, then hold the 'control' key and click on Toddle, then select 'Open'. Then choose Open from the next window. See GIF below.<p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>The first time Toddle launches, you need to allow access to control your computer. This is just used to disable the keyboard and mouse — nothing else!
      <br>
      When prompted, open System Preferences and tick the box next to Toddle (in Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility).
      <br>See GIF below.<br>
      <br>
      Once you've done this, you'll need to go to the Applications folder and relaunch Toddle. (No need to hold the 'control' key from now on.)

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Once opened, you can lock the keyboard and mouse by selecting "Lockdown" from the status bar menu (dummy icon in the top right of the screen). See image below.<br>
      You'll be asked to choose a password that you will use to unlock the keyboard and mouse when you're ready.

    <p>Once locked, just enter the password you chose to unlock, and that's it :)
