    <br>
    <br>
    <p>When prompted, you need to open System Preferences and allow Toddle to control your computer. This is required in order to disable the keyboard and mouse â€” nothing else!

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Once opened, you can lock the keyboard and mouse by selecting "Lockdown" from the status bar menu.<br>
      You'll be asked to choose a password that you will use to unlock the keyboard and mouse when you're ready.

    <p>Once locked, just enter the password you chose to unlock, and that's it :)
