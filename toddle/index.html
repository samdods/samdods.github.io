    <p>Toddle disables the keyboard and mouse so that your little one can join video calls with loved ones without accidentally quitting.
    
    <br>
      <p style="color:#ff0000">
        You need to give Toddle access to 'control your computer'. This sounds scary, but it's just so that it can disable the keyboard and mouse, which is the whole point of it.
        <br>
        <br>
        It's a bit convoluted the first time you use it, but once you've set it up, it's easy to use from then on. 
        
      
      <br>
      <p style="font-weight:bold">
      Step 1: Download to Applications folder
    </p>
    <p>Download and unzip, then move Toddle into your Applications folder. See GIF below.</p>
    <br>

    <br>
      <p style="font-weight:bold">
      Step 2: First time you open
    </p>
    <p>The first time you launch Toddle, it will tell you it's from an untrusted developer. This is just because I haven't paid the Apple developer membership fee.<br>
      <br>
      So to open it (only the first time), you have to go to your Applications folder, then hold the 'control' key and click on Toddle, then select 'Open'. Then choose Open from the next window. See GIF below.<p>
    <br>

    <br>
      <p style="font-weight:bold">
      Step 3: Allow Toddle to control your computer
    </P>
    <p>The first time Toddle launches, you need to allow access to control your computer. This is just used to disable the keyboard and mouse â€” <b>nothing else!</b>
      <br>  
      <br>
      When prompted, open System Preferences and tick the box next to Toddle (in Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility).
      <br>
      <b>You will need to click on the padlock in the bottom left of the window to make changes.</b>
      <br>
      <br>See GIF below.<br>
      <br>
    <img src="ezgif-6-eb1c3efd9651.gif"\>    
    <br>
    <br>
      <p style="font-weight:bold">
      Step 4: Re-open Toddle and go into "Lockdown" (disable keyboard and mouse)
    </P>
      Once you've done this, you'll need to go to the Applications folder and relaunch Toddle. (Just double click it to open, as usual.)
      <br>
    <p>Now you should see Toddle's 'dummy' icon in the status bar in the top right of your screen.
    <br>
    Next time you have a video call, lock the keyboard and mouse by selecting "Lockdown" from the status bar menu (dummy icon). See image below.<br>
    <br>
      You'll be asked to choose a password that you will use to unlock the keyboard and mouse when you're ready.

    <br>
    <br>
      <p style="font-weight:bold">
      Step 5: Let the little on loose on a video call
    </P>
    <p>Once locked, let your little one go wild. They'll probably still try to close the laptop lid, but I can't write any software to prevent that!

      <br>
      <br>
      <p style="font-weight:bold">
      Step 6: Go back to normal
    </P>
    To go back to normal, just enter the password you chose to unlock, and that's it :)
      <br>
      <br>

      <p style="color:#ff0000">
        If something goes wrong and you can't unlock by entering the password you chose, then you'll have to power-off your laptop by holding down the power button.
