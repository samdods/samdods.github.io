      Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Sam Dods. Welcome to my quiet little corner of the web!
      </p>
      <p>
      I'm Head of Mobile Engineering at <a href='https://kinandcarta.com/create'>Kin + Carta Europe</a>, with a history of specialising in iOS development and all things Mobile. <br><br>
      </p>
      <p>
      In 2018 I started writing new blog content on <a href='{{ site.medium_url }}'>Medium</a>, so that's where you'll find my latest technical articles. My <a href='archive'>archived posts</a> are still available.
