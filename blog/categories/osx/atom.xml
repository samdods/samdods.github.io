    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Delegate Pattern in Swift</h1>

<p>I started a long and mostly one-sided debate in the office last week, by suggesting that we should <em>not</em> change our delegate method signatures to conform to the Swift principle of <strong>omitting needless words</strong>.</p>

<p>My side of the debate was that we should follow the convention of prefixing delegate methods with the name of the delegating class, as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">func scrollViewDidScroll(_ scrollView: UIScrollView)
</code></pre>

<p>The other side of the debate was, “Come on, man, this is Swift 3. Those words are not needed, so omit them! It’s more clear at the point of use!” And this side of the debate suggested we adopt the following naming convention:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">func didScroll(in scrollView: UIScrollView)
</code></pre>

<p>In this article, I’ll rationalise my side of the debate, but also ask the question: is delegation even the right pattern?</p>

<!-- More -->


<h2>Clarity at the point of use</h2>

<p>A large part of writing an API is to allow others to invoke our method implementations. We provide an interface to our code. And we should make is as simple as possible to interface with. We’ll write a method once, but many people will call our method, possibly many times. So clarity at the point of use is more important than at the point of declaration. This is also referred to as clarity at the call site.</p>

<p>Delegate methods are different to typical methods in our interface. By declaring a delegate protocol, we are writing a contract. This contract defines an interface to code that we expect others to implement. The roles are reversed for delegate methods. Instead of inviting someone to invoke a method that we implemented, we’re asking them to implement the method, so that we can call it. So the guidelines should be reversed too. We will call the method once, but many people will implement that method, possibly many times. The “point of use” now refers to where the method is implemented by those using our API. I’ll refer to this as the implementation site.</p>

<p>The most important thing is still clarity at the point of use, only that point of use is now the implementation site. And the most important thing to ensure clarity around is that the method &ldquo;belongs to&rdquo; our API. That is to say, &ldquo;you implement it, but don&rsquo;t call it. We&rsquo;ll call it.&rdquo; The best way to make this clear is to prefix the method with the name of the delegating class.</p>

<p><em>As as aside, even if the guidelines were not reversed, I still don&rsquo;t agree that <code>didScroll(in:)</code> is clearer at the call site. <code>delegate?.didScroll(in: self)</code> is misleading. It wasn&rsquo;t the delegate that scrolled in self – it was self that scrolled!</em></p>

<h2>Passing a reference to the sender</h2>

<p>While this debate was taking place, it was also touted that you needn&rsquo;t pass the reference to the sender. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t need it, don&rsquo;t send it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Actually, the delegate pattern is defined such that the delegate can implement the method on behalf of the delegating class, with the full original context of the sender. This is achieved in Swift by sending a reference to <code>self</code>. And when defining an API for others to consume, one should stick to the definition of the delegate pattern by providing the original context.</p>

<p>Moreover, you risk taking brevity too far and instead of having:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">func didScroll(in scrollView: UIScrollView)
</code></pre>

<p>you&rsquo;ll end up with just:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">func didScroll()
</code></pre>

<p>And where&rsquo;s the sense in that?!</p>

<p>A lot of people are suggesting that Apple just haven&rsquo;t updated their <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/Articles/NamingMethods.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001282-1001803-BCIDAIJE">Coding Guidelines for Delegate Methods</a> since Objective-C. And if they did, perhaps they would review it with Swift&rsquo;s <a href="https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/">API Design Guidelines</a> in mind.</p>

<p>However, I disagree again. Apple provided documentation on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Protocols.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH25-ID276">Delegation</a> in the book <em>The Swift Programming Language (updated for Swift 3.0.1)</em>. It doesn&rsquo;t explicitly state that a reference to the sender must be passed as an argument, but they do follow that convention in all of their examples. They also (almost) follow the convention of prefixing all the delegate methods with the name of the delegating class. (Although in their examples, it&rsquo;s actually a delegating protocol type <code>DiceGame</code> and the delegate methods each have the consistent prefix <code>game</code>.)</p>

<h2>Following convention</h2>

<p>Conventions are there to be followed. But rules are there to be broken, right? Otherwise how would we innovate? I agree with this, but I don&rsquo;t agree with breaking convention to end up with something that&rsquo;s <em>less</em> clear.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/khanlou">Soroush Khanlou</a>&rsquo;s article about <a href="http://khanlou.com/2016/09/swifty-delegates/">Swifty Delegates</a>, he suggests that in an ideal future Apple would update UIKit to follow a more &lsquo;Swifty&rsquo; delegate method signature. UIKit already strays from convention with the <code>UITableViewDataSource</code> method <code>numberOfSections(in:)</code>.</p>

<p>While I respect Soroush&rsquo;s opinion, and have thoroughly enjoyed many of his articles, I disagree that this is the future. I actually think UIKit would be better if anomolies like this were corrected. So this example would become <code>tableViewNumberOfSections(_:)</code>.</p>

<p>The prefix is there to distinguish between other methods that the delegate might want to implement. Apple is delegating this functionality to the consumer of its API. They are asking the consumer to implement this method. I don&rsquo;t want to implement it, but I have to, because Apple expects me to. And as such, I&rsquo;d prefer it to have the <code>tableView</code> prefix, so I know – and others after me know – that this method belongs to the delegating class, and it&rsquo;s not just some method I&rsquo;ve implemented for my own benefit.</p>

<p>But of course, that&rsquo;s just my opinion. I&rsquo;ve expressed my will and desire.</p>

<p>But what is ultimately much more important, is this:</p>

<p>If you want to later query the number of sections in the table, from your delegate (say, a view controller), are you going to call:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">self.numberOfSections(in: tableView) // Swifty-style delegate method implemented on the view controller
</code></pre>

<p>or the following?</p>

<pre><code class="swift">self.tableView.numberOfSections
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;d recommend the latter, although with the number of sections it&rsquo;s <em>probably</em> safe to call either. But what if you want to find the cell for a given row? Assuming UIKit had taken Soroush&rsquo;s advice, then which of the following would you call?</p>

<pre><code class="swift">self.cellForRow(at: indexPath, in: tableView) // Swifty-style delegate method implemented on the view controller
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code class="swift">self.tableView.cellForRow(at: indexPath)
</code></pre>

<p>It might be tempting to call the former because you start typing <code>cell...</code> and auto-complete serves it to you on a plate. But my advice would be to call the latter, given that only the <em>delegating class</em> should ever call the <em>delegate method</em>.</p>

<p>But wouldn&rsquo;t it be really confusing if those <code>UITableViewDataSource</code> methods were really declared as Soroush suggested? And if we all stray from convention – to make our delegate method signatures more &lsquo;Swifty&#8217; – then we risk making our APIs confusing. The prefix convention highlights that this method should only be called by the delegating class.</p>

<h2>But is delegation even the correct pattern?</h2>

<p>If you strictly follow the <a href="https://www.objc.io/issues/7-foundation/communication-patterns/">guidelines laid out by the objc.io guys</a>, then you might find yourself using delegation a lot less. But their article isn&rsquo;t new, so is the delegate pattern still overused? Probably, yes. But then if we&rsquo;re drawing inspiration from UIKit et al, then it&rsquo;s obvious why.</p>

<p>But blocks weren&rsquo;t present at the birth of UIKit. They came on the scene with iOS 4, and quickly gained popularity with many open source libraries extending UIKit to provide block-based APIs. Blocks, or now <em>closures</em>, may be much more appropriate in many of the places the delegate pattern is used.</p>

<p>The dictionary definition of the verb <em>to delegate</em> is to:</p>

<blockquote><p>entrust a task or responsibility to another entity, typically one who is less senior than oneself.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;m not going to get into a debate about who&rsquo;s more senior: a view controller or a table view. But the important bit is that delegation is <em>entrusting a task</em> to another entity. It&rsquo;s <em>not</em> about notifying!</p>

<p>Some examples that came up during our debate were similar to this:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">func myCellDidTapAdd(_ cell: MyCell)
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>func didTapAdd(on cell: MyCell)
</code></pre>

<p>This is a prime example of when a closure would solve the problem better than the delegate pattern.</p>

<h3>Closures</h3>

<p>A closure may be better here because you&rsquo;ll typically have access to the cell&rsquo;s index path at the point at which you set the closure. The index path is much more useful than the cell itself, which would be passed to the delegate method implementation. This is because you&rsquo;re likely to look up an item from your data source using its index. It avoids having to call <code>tableView.indexPath(for: cell)</code> and guarding against a <code>nil</code> index path being returned. And within the closure you can call your own method, which <em>you&rsquo;ve</em> implemented because <em>you</em> want it to do something, with the arguments <em>you</em> need, rather than it being dictated by a delegating class that you <em>must</em> implement it.</p>

<h3>Target/Action</h3>

<p>And target/action might be better in many places too. Target/action is a great mechanism, which was vastly improved by the addition of <code>#selector</code> in Swift 2.2. If it&rsquo;s a simple case of delegating that something was tapped, why not make it a <code>UIControl</code> subclass and hook it up via target/action?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen so many times a custom view with a <code>UITapGestureRecognizer</code>, where the method for the tap delegates its handling to the custom view&rsquo;s delegate. Have you ever seen something like this?</p>

<pre><code class="swift">@IBAction private func handleTap(tap: UITapGestureRecognizer) {
    delegate?.myCustomViewWasTapped(self)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Why not try the following?</p>

<pre><code class="swift">@IBAction private func handleTap(tap: UITapGestureRecognizer) {
    sendActions(for: .touchUpInside)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can either set up the target/action in code, or hook it up in interface builder if appropriate.</p>

<p>And, as mentioned above with closures, the method that&rsquo;s implemented by the consumer can be whatever they choose. Both with closures and target/action, we allow the consumer of our API to write whatever methods they please, and they will still be &ldquo;notified&rdquo; by our object.</p>

<p>This means as a consumer we can hook the API into a method like <code>dismissCustomView()</code> instead of having to implement the delegate method <code>customViewDidTapDismiss(_:)</code>. This also means we don&rsquo;t need a separate method if we want to call this from somewhere else in our own code.</p>

<p>Furthermore, with target/action, it&rsquo;s the receiver that decides whether or not they need a reference to the sender. And if they want it, they&rsquo;ve got it. And if they don&rsquo;t, they can implement a method that takes no arguments.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I do think delegate methods are overused, but if we continue to use them then I think we should stick to convention. Mainly to avoid confusion, but also out of respect for the consumers of ones API – even if those consumers are only ones colleagues, or even oneself!</p>

<p>So when is it right to use the delegate pattern?</p>

<p>Typically I find that if you want something returned, then the delegate pattern is probably a good shout. Say, if you want to check if you should do something, then you&rsquo;ll expect a <code>Bool</code> to be returned. And this makes sense with the definition of delegation too. You&rsquo;re entrusting someone else to provide some information that you need.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;d suggest avoiding the delegate pattern if you&rsquo;re simply notifying another object of an action.</p>

<p>But of course, there are no hard and fast rules, and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so great about programming – we can always find better ways of doing things, and <a href="https://8thlight.com/blog/daniel-irvine/2016/11/11/perfect-code-is-an-illusion.html?utm_campaign=iOS%2BDev%2BWeekly&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=iOS_Dev_Weekly_Issue_277">we don&rsquo;t need to get it right first time</a>!</p>

<p>And if we continue to ask questions like this, then we continue to improve as developers. And surely that&rsquo;s the most important thing.</p>

    <updated>2015-09-21T08:00:37+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://sam.dods.co/blog/2015/09/21/some-swift-best-practices</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started learning Swift the day it was announced and read Apple&rsquo;s <em>The Swift Programming Language</em> in the first couple of days. I began writing small components and playing around with Swift at the same time, but never felt it was mature enough to begin a big project with it.</p>

<p>That was until Swift 2.0 was announced in June. Since then I&rsquo;ve been using it more and more and recently started writing a major project at <a href="www.theappbusiness.com">The App Business</a> purely in Swift 2.0.</p>

<p>Read on for some of my observations &ndash; some are obvious and common, but hopefully some will be new to most people. Let me know if you have any of your own that I could add to the list!</p>

<!-- More -->


<h2>Prefer <code>let</code> over <code>var</code></h2>

<p>Train your brain and your keyboard-bashing fingers to write <code>let</code> by default. There may be times when you know up-front you&rsquo;ll need a mutable variable, but I still recommend using <code>let</code> until you absolutely need to modify its value. This is the most obvious of my best practices, but it&rsquo;s super important, so still worth a mention.</p>

<h2>Prefer <code>private</code> access control</h2>

<p>Again, this one is obvious, but still worth pointing out. It&rsquo;s always better to keep as much of your implementation <code>private</code>, which means it can only be accessed from the same source file.</p>

<h2>Prefer non-optionals</h2>

<p>Optionals are great. This concept does exist in other languages (Scala, Haskell, etc.), but much respect has to go to Chris Lattner for bringing it to Swift.</p>

<p>However, as useful as they can be, I would still try to avoid them where possible. It leads to much cleaner code if you have variables and properties that you know hold a value, or functions that you can guarantee return a non-nil value.</p>

<p>For example, I would prefer a function to throw an exception if it is unable to return a non-nil value. Take the SDK&rsquo;s <code>NSJSONSerialization.JSONObjectWithData</code> function. It guarantees that if it returns anything, it will return a non-nil <code>AnyObject</code>, otherwise it throws an exception.</p>

<h2>Prefer <code>guard let</code> over <code>if let</code></h2>

<p>What can you do in an <code>if let</code> code block? I would <em>almost</em> always opt for a <code>guard let</code> and return early. Early return tends to make the code that follows easier to read because you can guarantee the state of variables at that point. If you can&rsquo;t calculate a required value, then return early.</p>

<h2>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to <code>throw</code></h2>

<p>Instead of returning early, consider throwing an error, which is an alternative exit point from the function. Exception handling in Objective-C (<code>@try @catch</code>) was always possible, but frowned upon. In Swift, throwing errors is a fundamental concept and should be embraced.</p>

<p>I had a parsing function that returned an optional, returning <code>nil</code> if the data couldn&rsquo;t be parsed. This meant that the caller would have to check for <code>nil</code>. I refactored it to be a function that always returns a non-optional and <code>throws</code> an error if it can&rsquo;t do so (see above related to preferring non-optionals).</p>

<h2>Never <code>guard</code> against multiple conditions</h2>

<p>Consider the following code:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">guard let data = data,
          json = self.jsonFromData(data),
          authors = json["authors"] else {
  throw AuthorParserError
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above avoids the repetition of throwing the <code>AuthorParserError</code> in three places, but in my opinion it would be much better written as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">guard let data = data else {
  throw AuthorParserError
}
guard let json = self.jsonFromData(data) else {
  throw AuthorParserError
}
guard let authors = json["authors"] else {
  throw AuthorParserError
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above is better because you can now test each case individually. And you can be sure that you&rsquo;ve covered each case, because Xcode 7&rsquo;s awesome code coverage facility will highlight any of the conditions that are not tested.</p>

<h2>Always inject dependencies, even if only for testing purposes</h2>

<p>The great thing about Swift&rsquo;s optional function arguments is that you can dictate how something should ordinarily be used but at the same time open up your classes for easy testing - in particular mocking of dependencies.</p>

<p>If your class relies on something to handle network requests, for example, then why not pass that into the <code>init</code> function?</p>

<p>This will make testing a doddle, because you can mock the dependency, ensuring that you are only testing the functionality of that individual class. (Of course you <em>can</em> write more integrated tests too.)</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">public init(requestDelegate: MyClassRequestDelegate = RequestManager()) {
  self.requestDelegate = requestDelegate
}
</code></pre>

<p>The dependency in the above example is actually a protocol, which makes testing very simple, because we just need to mock an object that conforms to the protocol.</p>

<p>(Some people might even demand that the dependency is always injected, instead of defining the defaul. But I feel the main purpose for this type of dependency injection is for easy testing. Unless you&rsquo;re building a library, your app will probably always use the same dependency, so it usually makes sense to have a default.)</p>

<h2>Always <code>typealias</code> completion handlers (where possible)</h2>

<p>Despite <a href="http://www.fuckingclosuresyntax.com">the syntax of closures being somewhat confusing</a>, the syntax for type aliasing a closure is unquestionably simpler than the equivalent <code>typedef</code> in Objective-C. So always define a <code>typealias</code> for your completion handlers (unless they contain generics, in which case you can&rsquo;t).</p>

<pre><code>typealias SomethingCompletion = (result: SomeType) -&gt; Void
</code></pre>

<h2>Use <code>enum</code> to avoid ambiguity</h2>

<p>Here I&rsquo;m referring to a tuple or a set of completion handler arguments that may give rise to ambiguity.</p>

<p>Consider the following completion handler:</p>

<pre><code>doSomething() { (output: NSData?, error: NSError?) in
  // need to check if we have output or error
}
</code></pre>

<blockquote><p>Note that I&rsquo;m still using NSError as part of the completion handler, rather than throwing an exception, because you can&rsquo;t throw an exception asynchronously.</p></blockquote>

<p>The above shows a completion handler which takes two optional values as its arguments. This goes against one of my previous points of &ldquo;avoiding optionals&rdquo; where possible.</p>

<p>What happens in the above if we have neither <code>output</code> nor <code>error</code>. Or what if we have both? Which do we handle?</p>

<p>You should be clear about the arguments to your completion handler, and you can use <code>enum</code> to help. For example, you could define the following:</p>

<pre><code>enum Result&lt;U&gt; {
  case .Success(output: U)
  case .Failure(error: NSError)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can rewrite the above use of the completion handler as:</p>

<pre><code>doSomething() { result in
  switch (result) {
  case .Success(let output):
    // use output
  case .Failure(let error):
    // handle error
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is absolutely clear now that if it was successful, there will be a non-nil output. And we even know the type of it, assuming the <code>doSomething</code> function specialises the generic <code>Result</code>. And likewise it is clear that if it failed there will be a non-nil error. And it can only succeed or fail, so there is no ambiguity.</p>

<h2>A trick for generic completion handling</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say you have a function declared in a protocol as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">protocol ServiceProvider {
  func provideService&lt;U where U: AnyService&gt;(completion: (output: U) -&gt; Void)
}
</code></pre>

<p>When making a class conform to the <code>ServiceProvider</code> protocol (i.e. when implementing this function), as long as we know how to instantiate an object of type <code>U where U: AnyService</code>, then we can return an object of the correct type. (The <code>AnyService</code> protocol must provide a way of returning an instance.)</p>

<p>It is then up to the caller to dictate in the completion closure what type of object should be returned.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>myOtherClass.provideService { (output: RoomService) in
  // do something with the RoomService
}
</code></pre>

<p>The implementation of the <code>provideService</code> function doesn&rsquo;t need to know anything about the <code>RoomService</code> class. It simply has to conform to <code>AnyService</code>, which allows it to be instantiated somehow.</p>

<p>What I really like about this, is that the caller can get back whatever they want back. The caller simply says, &ldquo;in the completion handler, I want an instance of <code>RoomService</code>&rdquo; and the implementation of the function knows how to deliver.</p>

<p>This is in stark contrast with Objective-C, where we would define a completion block argument of type <code>id</code> and the caller would tell the compiler what type of object they <em>expect</em> back when they implement the completion handler. But in Swift, we are <em>guaranteed</em> an object of this type. What&rsquo;s more, we are given this guarantee at compile time.</p>

<h2>Closure best practices</h2>

<p>I try to keep closures as concise as possible.</p>

<ul>
<li>If a closure returns <code>Void</code>, I don&rsquo;t write the return type</li>
<li>If the type of the object can be inferred by the compiler, then don&rsquo;t write the type</li>
<li>If the closure only has a single argument, then don&rsquo;t put it in parentheses</li>
<li>Always make the closure the last argument to a function</li>
<li>Always trail the closure when implementing</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t write redundant parentheses that the compiler doesn&rsquo;t require (for example, if the function only has one argument and that argument is the closure)</li>
</ul>


<p>These are largely up for debate, but this is the way I&rsquo;m writing things right now. For example:</p>

<pre><code>myObject.doSomething { output in
  // do something with the output
}
</code></pre>

<p>As opposed to:</p>

<pre><code>myObject.doSomething() { (output: NSData?) -&gt; Void in
  // do something with the output
}
</code></pre>

    <updated>2015-08-04T08:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://sam.dods.co/blog/2015/08/04/why-i-love-swift-protocol-extensions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When protocol extensions were first mentioned at WWDC in June, they immediately stood out as a necessary feature. But it was only after I started playing around with them that I realised the true value these bring to the language.</p>

<!-- More -->


<h2>The problems in Objective-C that are somewhat solved by Swift</h2>

<h3>The ability to &ldquo;mix in&rdquo; functionality to classes</h3>

<p>When you want to extend a class in Objective-C, you would typically create a category on that class.</p>

<p>Say in my app I have defined the <code>Video</code>, <code>Photo</code> and <code>Song</code> classes, which have the shared superclass <code>MediaItem</code>.</p>

<p>Now I want to give each of these classes some functionality to make them <code>Shareable</code>. And I would expect this functionality to mostly be the same in each class.</p>

<p>Now you might suggest I implement the shareable functionality in their common superclass, and then somehow specify whether each one is shareable. But I might not want all future subclasses to inherit this functionality, and I may want to give this functionality to other classes that don&rsquo;t inherit from <code>MediaItem</code>. For example, I might want to make <code>UserProfile</code> shareable, so my users can share each other&rsquo;s profiles.</p>

<blockquote><p>With inheritance, you would typically follow the &ldquo;is a&rdquo; principle, meaning an object of your subclass type is an object of its superclass type and inherits common properties. For example, in real life, a <code>Dog</code> <em>is a</em> <code>Mammal</code> so it would make sense to inherit from the <code>Mammal</code> class.</p>

<p>A <code>Dog</code> should also be capable of other functionality, for example being able to <code>run</code>. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to implement that functionality in the <code>Mammal</code> class, because it would not apply to the <code>Whale</code>, which is also a subclass of <code>Mammal</code>.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to have a <code>Runner</code> class for <code>Dog</code> to inherit from, because a <code>Dog</code> isn&rsquo;t necessarily a <code>Runner</code>, so the &ldquo;is a&rdquo; principle doesn&rsquo;t apply. Being able to <code>run</code> is a capability rather than a property.</p></blockquote>

<p>So how can I provide the <code>Shareable</code> functionality to my media classes without implementing it in each class individually? Well in Objective-C it simply isn&rsquo;t possible. Of course, you could add the shared functionality to a category on <code>NSObject</code>. But then (almost) all of your classes will inherit this functionality, which you don&rsquo;t want.</p>

<p>This is where Swift&rsquo;s protocol extensions come in handy. You could define the <code>Shareable</code> protocol like so:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">protocol Shareable {}
extension Shareable {
  func share() {
    // common share functionality
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now any class that you declare as conforming to the <code>Shareable</code> protocol will &ldquo;adopt&rdquo; the sharing functionality. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">class Photo: MediaItem, Shareable {
  // func share() adopted from Shareable protocol
}

class UserProfile: Shareable {
  // func share() adopted from Shareable protocol
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you are familiar with Ruby, you will see the resemblence to what is known as a mixin.</p>

<h3>The requirement to check <code>respondsToSelector:</code></h3>

<p>For aeons people have been trying to work around this problem, for example Peter Steinberger&rsquo;s <a href="http://petersteinberger.com/blog/2013/smart-proxy-delegation/">Smart Proxy Delegation</a>. But all such solutions are only work arounds.</p>

<p>We all know that pure Swift protocols don&rsquo;t support optional methods. And Swift objects don&rsquo;t support <code>respondsToSelector</code>. But with protocol extensions, none of this matters!</p>

<p>We can simplify what used to be five rather ugly lines of Objective-C&hellip;</p>

<pre><code class="objc">BOOL shouldBegin = YES;
id&lt;DataServiceDelegate&gt; delegate = self.delegate;
if ([delegate respondsToSelector:@selector(dataServiceShouldBeginSync:)]) {
  shouldBegin = [delegate dataServiceShouldBeginSync:self];
}
</code></pre>

<p>&hellip; into a single line of Swift&hellip;</p>

<pre><code class="swift Swift">let shouldBegin = delegate.dataServiceShouldBeginSync(self)
</code></pre>

<p>This is acheived by defining the default implementation of this methods in an extension to the protocol, as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">extension DataServiceDelegate {
  func dataServiceShouldBeginSync(dataService: DataService) -&gt; Bool {
    return YES;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The additional beauty of this is that it makes the default behaviour explicitly clear to the consumer of your interface. No longer do they have to hunt around in possibly out-of-date documentation to figure out what will happen if they don&rsquo;t implement this methods themselves. And the default behaviour isn&rsquo;t hidden in the implementation.</p>

<h2>The additional powers of protocol extensions</h2>

<p>You can specify a &ldquo;where&rdquo; clause for your extension, so that only specific conforming classes adopt the functionality defined in the extension.</p>

<p>This allows us to define different default behaviour depending on the class that conforms to the protocol. For example, I could define the following protocol:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">protocol Shareable {
  func share()
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I can specify that any object that conforms to this protocol should use the default behaviour as defined:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">extension Shareable {
  func share() {
    print("sharing something")
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And I can specify that all media items have a different default behaviour:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">extension Shareable where Self : MediaItem {
  func share() {
    print("sharing a media item!")
  }
}
</code></pre>

<blockquote><p>Note that this is not the same as providing this implementation in the <code>MediaItem</code> class, because this doesn&rsquo;t mean all <code>MediaItem</code> objects are <code>Shareable</code>. Only subclasses that conform to the <code>Shareable</code> protocol will pick up this functionality.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is demonstrated below:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">class UserProfile : Shareable {}
class AudioTrack : MediaItem, Shareable {}
class Video : MediaItem {}

let userProfile = UserProfile()
userProfile.share()
// prints "sharing something"

let audio = AudioTrack()
audio.share()
// prints "sharing a media item!"

let video = Video()
video.share()
// results in a compiler error: value of type 'Video' has no member 'share'
</code></pre>

<p>This also means that you can refer to <code>self</code> in the default implementation and access the properties of <code>self</code> with the knowledge that it is of a particular type. For example, the <code>MediaItem</code>  might have a <code>copyrightTerms</code> property, so I can use it in my default implementation as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">extension Shareable where Self : MediaItem {
  func share() {
    if (self.copyrightTerms) {
      // present the copyright terms to the user, asking them to accept before continuing.
    } else {
      // complete share action without showing copyright terms.
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>So are there any drawbacks?</h2>

<p>Like with so many language features: with great power comes great responsibility. And even more importantly, comes the greater need to fully understand how something works.</p>

<p>The methods in a protocol extension can also be implemented in the class that conforms to the protocol. The implementation in the class overrides the &ldquo;default&rdquo; implementation in the protocol extension. What&rsquo;s more is that if the implementation is added to the class in the form of a class extension, then it too overrides the protocol extension implementation. This can get very confusing if you are defining different implementations using the &ldquo;where&rdquo; syntax.</p>

<p>As more people become accustomed to writing Swift, I&rsquo;m sure the most common use for protocol extensions will be for the default implementation of &ldquo;optional&rdquo; delegate methods.</p>

<p>But for those that do use them as a kind of &ldquo;mixin&rdquo;, I&rsquo;d suggest erring on the side of caution and making your intent very clear.</p>

    <updated>2015-05-02T11:50:25+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://sam.dods.co/blog/2015/05/02/stencil-xcode-plugin</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/stencil-xcode-plugin/">Stencil</a> is an Xcode plugin that provides the ability to create custom file templates and use them in your project to create new files. It&rsquo;s intended to save you time while making it easy to extend a project in the future: for you, next week; for your current colleagues; and especially for people that might inherit a project from you in the future.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve used <a href="/stencil-xcode-plugin/">Stencil</a> to create a custom template, you can create new files based on this template. The new files can include Objective-C headers and implementation files, interface builder files (.xib and .storyboard), as well as Swift source files.</p>

<p>It really adds benefit when there&rsquo;s a particular class that you commonly subclass, especially if the new subclass requires an interface builder counterpart.</p>

<p>Of course you would want to document your project to explain that you have defined custom templates, which can be used with the <a href="/stencil-xcode-plugin/">Stencil</a> plugin. But if one of your co-workers doesn&rsquo;t have the plugin, then it doesn&rsquo;t matter. No harm done, it just means they won&rsquo;t reap the benefits. And you can spend longer on your tea break, while they&rsquo;re spending longer doing things manually!</p>

<h1>Creating a custom file template, by example</h1>

<p>In a hypothetical social-network-like project, I have an abstract <code>SectionViewController</code> class, which will be subclassed for various sections of the app. For example, we have a <code>FriendsSectionViewController</code> and in the future we might want to add a <code>GroupsSectionViewController</code> and an <code>EventsSectionViewController</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>SectionViewController</code> interface looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="objc">@interface SectionViewController : UIViewController
@property (nonatomic, weak) IBOutlet UITableView *tableView;
@property (nonatomic, strong) Section *section;

// may be implemented in subclasses, invoked when a table cell is selected.
- (void)didSelectItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath;
@end
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s implementation takes care of the table&rsquo;s data source using the specified <code>Section</code> object, and implements the necessary delegate methods.</p>

<p>Subclasses are simply expected to implement the <code>-didSelectItemAtIndexPath:</code> method as described in the interface. Each subclass will also have its own storyboard file, which must link up a <code>UITableView</code> to the outlet in the superclass and provide a prototype cell with a specific reuse identifier. The <code>UITableView</code> will also hook up its <code>delegate</code> and <code>dataSource</code> outlets to the view controller.</p>

<p>In order to create a new subclass, say <code>GroupsSectionViewController</code>, I would need to create the new class files (<code>.h</code> and <code>.m</code>) and create separately the new storyboard file. In the implementation, I would need to override the <code>-didSelectItemAtIndexPath:</code> method. In the storyboard, I would need to add a new view controller, embedded in a navigation controller; add a <code>UITableView</code> and hook it up to the outlet; hook up the table&rsquo;s <code>delegate</code> and <code>dataSource</code> outlets; and add a prototype cell and give it the necessary reuse identifier, as required by the <code>SectionViewController</code> implementation. Sounds tedious!</p>

<h2>Simplifying repetitive tasks</h2>

<p>This is where <a href="/stencil-xcode-plugin/">Stencil</a> comes in. We can create a template based on an existing subclass of <code>SectionViewController</code>, to simplify adding a new section in the future. This will not only save my time, but make it much easier for a new joiner to get up to speed with the project and get stuck in making a new section, following the pattern that already exists in the project.</p>

<p>Simply select the files that you wish to base your template upon, and select the new option to <em>New Template from Selection</em>, as in the image below.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/stencil/create-new-template.jpg" title="&lsquo;Create File Template from Group&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>In the options window that is presented, I&rsquo;ll leave the <em>Interface or protocol</em> option as &ldquo;interface FriendsSectionViewController&rdquo;, because this is the interface I wish to make a template from (it&rsquo;s the only interface defined in the selected files).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll change the <em>New will inherit from</em> option to &ldquo;SectionViewController&rdquo; because this is what I want newly created files to inherit from. (I don&rsquo;t want them to inherit from FriendsSectionViewController.)</p>

<p>The <em>Template name</em> is defaulted to &ldquo;SectionViewController&rdquo; so I&rsquo;ll leave that, and I&rsquo;ll add a useful description so people know what it is in the future. I&rsquo;ll leave all other options as the defaults. See image below.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/stencil/create-template-options.jpg" title="&lsquo;Template Creation Options&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>You will then be presented with the template files for you to edit. Ensure you don&rsquo;t modify the parts of the code that have references like <code>___FILEBASENAMEASIDENTIFIER___</code>, as this is what Xcode will replace when you use your template in the future.</p>

<p>Remove any functionality that is specific to the class you used to create the template. Leave stubs of methods that you expect to be implemented in new classes that you create based on your template. See image below.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/stencil/editing-new-template.jpg" title="&lsquo;Editing The Template&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>If your template includes an Interface Builder file, the template file will be presented in a separate window. Remove any views or controllers that are specific to the class you used to create the template. You can leave outlets connected and don&rsquo;t modify the custom class <code>___FILEBASENAMEASIDENTIFIER___</code>. See image below.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/stencil/editing-ui-template.jpg" title="&lsquo;Editing Interface Builder Template&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>After following the instructions that are presented to you in an Xcode window, make your changes to the template files, close the window(s) and return to your project.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it! You&rsquo;ve now created your own custom file template. It will be saved under your project&rsquo;s directory (under the <code>StencilPlugin</code> subdirectory), so you can commit it to source control.</p>

<h1>Using your template to create a new file</h1>

<p>So far in my project, I only have a <code>FriendsSectionViewController</code>. Now it&rsquo;s time to add a <code>GroupsSectionViewController</code>. To use the template created above, simply right-click in the Project Navigator and select <em>New File from Custom Template&hellip;</em>. This will present all templates that are associated with this project. See image below.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/stencil/new-from-template.jpg" title="&lsquo;New File from Custom Template&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Select the <code>SectionViewController</code> template created previously. See image below.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/stencil/select-custom-template.jpg" title="&lsquo;Selecting Custom Template&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Give your new class a name, in my case this will be <code>GroupsSectionViewController</code>. Your new files will be created, just like usual. You&rsquo;ll see the code files and the Interface Builder files all present in the Project Navigator. The storyboard file has the <code>UITableView</code> hooked up, as well as its <code>delegate</code> and <code>dataSource</code>. The code files have stubs of the methods that I&rsquo;m expected to implement in the new subclass. See image below.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/stencil/new-files-created.jpg" title="&lsquo;New Files Created&rsquo; &lsquo;images&rsquo;" ></p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p><a href="/stencil-xcode-plugin/">Stencil</a> may not provide benefit to every kind of project. But generally &ndash; if extending the app means that you frequently subclass a particular class &ndash; then you can find benefits in using the <a href="/stencil-xcode-plugin/">Stencil</a> plugin. You might find yourself subclassing a <code>WidgetView</code> for example, it&rsquo;s much quicker to use <a href="/stencil-xcode-plugin/">Stencil</a> to produce your new files, which may include a <code>.xib</code> file. And it makes it immediately clear to people joining the project in the future what methods are expected to be implemented in new subclasses.</p>

    <updated>2015-04-06T22:05:57+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://sam.dods.co/blog/2015/04/06/swift-alternatives-to-c-macros</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Love them or hate them, macros are an integral part of C development, and are widely used throughout the Objective-C Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks. If you&rsquo;ve ever used <code>NSAssert</code>, then you&rsquo;ve used a macro. (And if you haven&rsquo;t, then what have you been doing?!)</p>

<p>Now please bear with me&hellip; before all you macro-haters completely disregard this blog post, this is not another one of those posts that explains the trivial procedure of re-writing a function-like macro as a function in Swift. Nor will I show the Swift alternative to a macro definition of a primitive constant, as I&rsquo;ve seen in other recent posts within the community.</p>

<p>In this short series, I&rsquo;m going to look at some of the more creative uses of C macros and investigate how we could use some of Swift&rsquo;s advanced language features to accomplish the same results.</p>

<!-- More -->


<h1>Misuse of macros</h1>

<p>I have come across a few blog posts recently which take various types of Objective-C macro and find alternative solutions in Swift. But every macro discussed could have been written as a function (or even worse declared as a constant) in Objective-C in the first place, so would be trivial to convert to Swift. I was going crazy staring at the screen in disbelief of people converting macros such as the following:</p>

<pre><code class="objc">#define SQUARE_NUMBER(n) n * n
</code></pre>

<p>The blog post failed to point out that the Objective-C developer that wrote this macro in the first place should have been shot in the head with a <a href="http://nerf.hasbro.com/en-us">Nerf</a> gun and sent back to junior school. There is so much wrong with that macro, I don&rsquo;t want to waste any more of my life discussing it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t condone or encourage the use of macros in Objective-C where functions or constants could be used instead, and I don&rsquo;t think that any other iOS developer should do so either. And I certainly don&rsquo;t think the Objective-C community should be encouraging this by promoting or linking to this type of blog post.</p>

<p>There is never a need to write a function-like macro in Objective-C. If you&rsquo;re worried about performance (of calling out to a function), then there&rsquo;s no need. Cocoa provides the macros <code>NS_INLINE</code>, <code>CF_INLINE</code>, etc. which mean that your friend the compiler will decide whether it&rsquo;s appropriate to expand the function definition in-line. See the definition of the <code>CGRectMake</code> function for example. And there is certainly no need to <code>#define</code> primitive constants!</p>

<p>Yet even <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/InteractingWithCAPIs.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH8-XID_19">Apple&rsquo;s documentation</a> seems to condone the use of primitive constants being declared as a macro. By the time I read this, I was getting pretty fed up. Why is everyone, including Apple, encouraging the misuse of macros?!</p>

<p>Apple&rsquo;s example below should never have been written as a macro in the first place.
&#8220;`objc</p>

<h1>define FADE_ANIMATION_DURATION 0.35</h1>

<pre><code>It provides no type-safety and it won't be available to interrogate in the debugger. There's a real danger this type of macro could be misused and lead to hard-to-diagnose bugs. In short, it's code smell that should be avoided at all times, with no excuses.

# So are macros ever acceptable?

Some people would probably argue the fact that it's never acceptable to use macros. I would encourage those people to read on because you might discover some cool tricks!

I wrote recently about KVC collection operators and [how to use them safely](/blog/2014/07/25/collection-operators-done-properly/). In that post, I discuss the use of macros to provide compile-time checking on the keys used in key-value coding.

Consider the following example interfaces:
</code></pre>

<p>@interface Account : NSObject
@property double balance;
@end</p>

<p>@interface Transaction : NSObject
@property Account <em>account;
@property double value;
@end
<code>``
I can use KVC collection operators to simplify retrieval of transaction characteristicts from an array of</code>Transaction </em>` objects:</p>

<pre><code class="objc">double minimumValue = [transactions valueForKeyPath:@"@min.value"];
double maximumAccountBalance = [transactions valueForKeyPath:@"@max.account.balance"];
NSArray *accounts = [transactions valueForKeyPath:@"unionOfObjects.account"];
NSArray *accounts = [transactions valueForKey:@"account"]; // same as above
</code></pre>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t used a macro yet! But I can use macros as defined in <a href="/blog/2014/07/25/collection-operators-done-properly/">my other post</a> to perform these operations and get compile-time checking of the key paths with code-completion <em>and</em> syntax highlighting! (The highlighter on my blog doesn&rsquo;t display it as nicely as Xcode does.)</p>

<pre><code class="objc">double minimumValue = DZLMinimum(transactions, Transaction *, value);
double maximumAccountBalance = DZLMaximum(transactions, Transaction *, account.balance);
NSArray *accounts = DZLUnionOfObjects(transactions, Transaction *, account);
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the key paths are not enclosed in quotes. This is due to how they are expanded at compile time to be verified and then turned into strings to pass to <code>-valueForKeyPath:</code>.</p>

<p>So a macro that adds compile-time validation and code-completion to an otherwise crash-prone interface is, in my opinion, a decent example of when to use macros in Objective-C.</p>

<h1>How does this type of macro translate to Swift?</h1>

<p>In the macros above, we pass the type expected in the array, namely <code>Transaction *</code> and pass the key path that we want to extract. In Swift, the type of objects in an array is mandatory when you declare the array, and we can extract information using the <code>map</code> or <code>reduce</code> functions.</p>

<p>For example, the above can be re-written in Swift as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="swift">var minimumValue = transactions.map({$0.value}).reduce(Int.min, {max($0, $1)})
var maximumValue = transactions.map({$0.account.balance}).reduce(Int.max, {min($0, $1)})
var accounts = transactions.map {$0.account}
</code></pre>

<p>You can read up on these functions in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Reference/SwiftStandardLibraryReference/Array.html">Apple&rsquo;s documentation</a>. I also use the shorthand name of the first closure argument <code>$0</code>, which is also discussed in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Closures.html">Apple&rsquo;s documentation</a>.</p>

<p>But you could easily argue that the above is a little long-winded, in which case you could simplify it by extending <code>Array</code>. I&rsquo;ve shown how to do this for the <code>minimum</code> below, but it could be easily modified for <code>maximum</code>, or <code>average</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="objc">extension Array {
  func mapMinimum&lt;U :Comparable&gt;(transform: (T) -&gt; U) -&gt; U? {
    var mapped:Array&lt;U&gt; = self.map(transform)
    return mapped.count == 0 ? nil : mapped.reduce(mapped.first!, { max($0, $1) })
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the above extension, I&rsquo;m defining the <code>mapMinimum</code> function, which can be invoked on an array whose members all conform to the <code>Comparable</code> protocol (in order to be passed into the <code>max</code> function). It returns the minimum of the members of the array resulting from calling <code>transform(x)</code> on all members <code>x</code> of <code>self</code>. In other words, it performs the <code>map</code> function with the given closure, and then returns the minimum of the resulting array.</p>

<p>Having declared the same for maximum, I can now use them as follows:
<code>objc
var minimumValue = transactions.mapMinimum {$0.value}
var maximumAccountBalance = transactions.mapMaximum {$0.account.balance}
</code></p>

<p>So the syntax is actually improved in Swift compared to the macros I defined in Objective-C. The key path is validated by the compiler, because it knows what types of object are contained in the <code>transactions</code> array.</p>

<h1>Next time&hellip;</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be investigating more of what I consider &ldquo;valid&rdquo; uses of macros and how we can achieve the same result using the advanced language features of Swift.</p>
